# PREDS_RGCs_ecRF
Code to generate figures for Riccitelli et al. "Retinal ganglion cells encode the direction of motion outside their classical receptive field"

# Overview
Matlab Script files are made available for download. Example data can be found in the same repository. Data (RGCs spiking activity) was recorded as described in the manuscript. 
Altogether, it should re-create the manuscript's figures: "Retinal ganglion cells encode the direction of motion outside their classical receptive field".

# System Requirements
This code requires only a standard computer. It is supported for macOS and Windows. 
MATLAB 2018 is requested.
